## Description

This Application is a Backend REST API for a basic Social Network Web Application

- When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database,

- When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON,

- When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my, database
